#Plaid Support#

##Welcome to the Plaid Support Channel##

Please submit all issues to the Plaid API v2.0.0 in this channel. If you're still using a previous version of the Plaid API, please send your questions via email to support+old@plaid.io - this channel is strictly for issues relating to API v2.0.0.


###Documentation###

Documentation for the Plaid API v2.0.0 is available at new.plaid.io/docs. Please tag any suggested edits to the docs.


###General Issues###

For most problems with the API, submitting an issue here will be sufficient. We check this repository daily and will work on bugs in order of priority. If your issue is particularly high-priority, please tag it as such.


###Immediate Support###

For major issues that require immediate support, please email us at support@plaid.io - we will try to respond within a few hours (there is pretty much always someone online at Plaid).


###Other Issues###

For client-specific issues (ex: you need a new API key) or other low-priority issues that are sensitifve in nature, please email support+lowpri@plaid.io and we will get it sorted. We value a public forum for bugs, fixes, and stupid questions - so please use this option sparingly.
