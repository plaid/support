##Sandbox Mode

A development mode is now available that works with both test user credetials and live accounts. All responses using the plaid_test username will fail, except those that use the correct and locked passwords below. Test credentials are full-featured, and should work as normal with the rest of the API, including the return of valid [response and error codes](https://github.com/plaid/support/blob/master/errors.md).

####Credentials:
```
username:           plaid_test
correct password:   plaid_good
locked password:    plaid_locked
bad password:       anything else
```

####For Question MFA:
```
correct answer:     tomato
bad answer:         anything else
```

####For Code MFA:
```
correct answer:     1234
bad answer:         anything else
```

####Other:
For ```/step``` and ```GET``` calls     
*access_token* : ```test```

Additionally, the list and login parameters are fully functional including webhook support.

##Categorization

A number of important updates were made to our category endpoint, resulting in higher quality categorization across the board. There is also an 'All Categories' endpoint now available that returns a JSON response containing all Plaid categories and their associated Factual and Foursquare mappings.

```
curl -X GET https://tartan.plaid.com/category
```

A full list of Plaid categories can be found [here](https://github.com/plaid/support/blob/master/categories.md)

##Error Codes

We now use standard HTTP response codes for success and failure notifications, and our errors are further classified by block. Errors are returned with a proper numeric code, http code, and description.

```
http code 402
{
  "code": 1200,
  "message": "invalid credentials",
  "resolve": "The username or password provided were not correct."
}
```

A detailed list of error codes and their descriptions can be found [here](https://github.com/plaid/support/blob/master/errors.md).

##MFA Responses

When an MFA credential is required, a ```201``` HTTP code will be returned.

###List type

{
  "type": "list",
  "mfa": [
    {"mask":"a...z@plaid.com", "type":"email"},
    {"mask":"xxx-xxx-1234", "type":"phone"},
    {"mask":"SafePass Card", "type":"card"}
  ]
  "access_token": "xxxxx"

##Category Response

```_category``` is now ```category``` which is an array of the hierarchy, and ```_category.id``` is now ```category_id```. Both of these will be returned with each transaction. 

```
{  
  "category": [
    "Food & Drink",
    "Restaurants",
    "French"
  ],  
  "category_id": "52544965f71e87d00700006c"  
}
```

The category endpoint will return information in the format:
```
http code 200
{
  "_id": "521440f12cce119f31000058",
  "stringified": "Food & Drink > Restaurants > Spanish"
  "hierarchy": [
    "Food & Drink",
    "Restaurants",
    "Spanish"
  ],
  "mappings": [
    { "hierarchy": [
        "Food",
        "Spanish Restaurant",
        "Paella Restaurant"
      ],
      "map_type": "foursquare"
    },
    { "hierarchy": [
        "Food",
        "Spanish Restaurant",
        ""
      ],
      "map_type": "foursquare"
    }
  ]
}
```
