| `error_type`      | A broad categorization of the error. One of: `INVALID_REQUEST`, `INVALID_INPUT`, `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`, `API_ERROR`, or `ITEM_ERROR`. Safe for programmatic use.                       |
| `error_code`      | The particular error code. Each `error_type` has a specific set of `error_code`s. <br /><br />  Safe for programmatic use.                                                             |
| `error_message`   | A developer-friendly representation of the error message.<br /><br />  This may change over time and is not safe for programmatic use.                                                 |
| `display_message` | A user-friendly representation of the error message. `null` if the error is not related to user action. <br /><br />   This may change over time and is not safe for programmatic use. |
